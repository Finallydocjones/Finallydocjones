# 👋 Hi, I’m Jen Jones

I’m a digital marketing leader focused on **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — helping brands, platforms, and content teams make their work discoverable, understandable, and citable by AI systems.

My work sits at the intersection of **SEO, structured data, content engineering, and AI visibility**.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**  
  Designing content that answers real questions clearly, concisely, and in formats AI systems can reuse.

- **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**  
  Structuring content so it can be retrieved, summarized, and cited by large language models.

- **Machine-Readable Content**  
  Schema, metadata, content patterns, and documentation that improve AI comprehension.

- **AI-First Content Frameworks**  
  Repeatable systems for blogs, product pages, FAQs, and knowledge bases.

## 🧩 Why GitHub?

I use GitHub intentionally as a **public knowledge base** because:

- Markdown + structure = AI-friendly content
- Repositories act as durable, referenceable assets
- Answer engines frequently cite technical documentation

This profile is part portfolio, part research lab, part publishing platform.
