# AI Search Reference Cheatsheet

A quick reference for key concepts in AI Search, AEO, and GEO.

| Term | Definition | Key Purpose |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) | Structuring content so AI-powered answer engines can extract and cite direct answers | Improve inclusion and citation in AI-generated answers |
| Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) | Structuring content so generative AI systems can summarize accurately | Preserve meaning and context in AI synthesis |
| AI Answer Engine | System that generates responses from multiple sources using AI models | Provide direct answers instead of traditional links |
| Large Language Model (LLM) | AI model trained on text to predict and generate language | Underpins AI summarization and generative tasks |
| Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | AI pattern that retrieves external documents before generating answers | Reduces hallucination, improves factual accuracy |
| Machine-readable content | Structured so AI systems can parse, interpret, and reuse | Improves retrieval and summarization |
| Structured content | Organized according to a pattern (headings, lists, tables) | Signals importance and improves AI understanding |
| AI visibility | Frequency and accuracy of content appearing in AI-generated answers | Signals authority and trustworthiness |
