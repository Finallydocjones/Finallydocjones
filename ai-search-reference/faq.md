# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?
AEO is the practice of structuring content so AI answer engines can extract, summarize, and cite direct answers. It focuses on **citation and inclusion** rather than traffic.

## What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?
GEO is the practice of structuring content so generative AI systems can summarize and synthesize accurately without altering meaning.

## How do AI answer engines summarize content?
They retrieve relevant documents, chunk content into passages, and synthesize answers using probabilistic reasoning. Structured, clear, and neutral content improves accuracy.

## How can I make my content AI-visible?
- Use clear, self-contained sections  
- Define terms explicitly  
- Maintain consistent terminology  
- Structure content with headings, lists, and tables  
- Avoid promotional or ambiguous language

## What is the difference between AEO and GEO?
- AEO → content extraction and citation  
- GEO → content summarization and transformation fidelity  
Both are required for AI visibility.
